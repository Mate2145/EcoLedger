# EcoLedger

EcoLedger is a technologically advanced platform that uses HyperLedger Fabric to ensure the verification of land ownership and the objective determination of carbon scores. It provides a secure, transparent, and efficient solution for validating land documents and assigning environmental value, thus facilitating the trade of carbon credits among landowners, organizations, and brokers.

## Overview

EcoLedger addresses the growing global demand for trustworthy and transparent systems that assess land-based carbon sequestration potential. By combining blockchain technology with advanced data processing techniques, it modernizes the traditional methods of land verification and environmental impact assessment.

## Motivation

- **Environmental Sustainability:** With the urgent need to reduce carbon footprints, accurate carbon scoring of land becomes critical.
- **Transparency and Trust:** Traditional methods are often cumbersome and error-prone; blockchain ensures immutable, verifiable records.
- **Market Efficiency:** A streamlined platform facilitates fair trading of carbon credits, benefiting landowners, organizations, and brokers alike.

## Functional Specifications

- **User Registration & Authentication:**  
  Secure sign-up and login, enhanced by blockchain-based identity management.
- **Document Upload & Verification:**  
  Users can upload land proof documents, which are securely stored and hashed for integrity.
- **Carbon Score Calculation:**  
  Automated processing to generate objective carbon scores based on predefined environmental criteria.
- **Blockchain Integration:**  
  HyperLedger Fabric records all transactions, ensuring transparency and data integrity.
- **Marketplace:**  
  A dedicated platform for listing, buying, and selling carbon credits and land assets.
- **Audit & Compliance:**  
  Comprehensive tracking of transactions for regulatory and compliance purposes.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain:**  
  HyperLedger Fabric for secure, permissioned transaction recording.
- **Backend:**  
  NodeJS with Express and LoopBack for robust API and server-side logic.
- **Frontend:**  
  Angular paired with Angular Material to create a responsive, user-friendly interface.
- **Containerization:**  
  Docker to streamline deployment and enhance scalability.
- **Testing & CI/CD:**  
  Integrated testing frameworks and CI/CD pipelines ensure high quality and continuous delivery.

## Architecture

EcoLedger's architecture is structured into three main layers:
1. **Presentation Layer:**  
   Developed using Angular, it provides the UI for document uploads, dashboard views, and marketplace interactions.
2. **Application Layer:**  
   Powered by NodeJS, this layer handles business logic, data processing, and carbon score computations.
3. **Blockchain Layer:**  
   HyperLedger Fabric underpins this layer, recording all transactions and providing an immutable ledger for land verification and carbon scoring.

## Use Cases

- **Land Ownership Verification:**  
  Secure and immutable recording of land documents.
- **Carbon Score Assessment:**  
  Automated, objective evaluation of a land parcel's carbon sequestration potential.
- **Marketplace for Carbon Credits:**  
  Facilitates transparent trading between landowners, organizations, and brokers.
- **Regulatory Compliance:**  
  Provides an auditable record of transactions to meet compliance standards.
